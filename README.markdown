Graphic artists need to look up reference pictures for drawing. Artists may follow the reference pictures or parts of them closely while drawing, or may use the reference picture just to determine particular shapes, proportions, or colors. Referant is a tool that aims to help artists find reference images that meets all of their needs and arrange them in desired ways.
